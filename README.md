# DataAnalysisBootcamp_Module6_Python-api-Challenge

WeatherPy
WeatherPy project was aimed at generating random geographic coordinates and analyzing weather data for the locations. The project purpose was to help in visualize weather patterns across different cities.
To complete this project I generated random geographic coordinates. I retrieved weather for these coordinates and analyzed and visualied the weather data using various plots.

Data Sources:
OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
Citipy for city data based on coordinates.

VacationPy
VacationPy project was designed to analyze weather data in order to plan a vacation. This project utilizes weather data and geographic coordinates to identify vacation destinations.
To complete this project I loaded and reprocessed the weather and coordinates data. I analyzed the weather patterns and identified suitable vacation destinations.
I used Matplotlib and other libraries to plot the data for visualization.

Data Sources:
OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
Citipy for city data based on coordinates.
